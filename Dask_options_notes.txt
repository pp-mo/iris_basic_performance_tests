NOTICING

when testing old synchronous version, CPU swap over but total loading is always <= 100%

when testing v with no dask-setopts, certain operations show evidence of parallel benefit :
  pp load plain - NO
  pp struct load - NO
  pp data load - NO (but lots of switching ??)

  FF load plain - NO
  FF struct load - NO
  FF data load - YES
  FF means calc - YES
  
  NC load - NO
  NC data load - ?YES
  NC mean calc - YES

  save PP 2 PP - NO
  save PP 2 NC - 
  save NC 2 NC - 
  save NC to PP - ~0 ? noisy?
